<h1>Simple Airline Management System (SAMS)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Airline Management System is a SQL-based project to simulate the management and operations of an airline company. This system manages various aspects, including tracking flights, managing airports, airplanes, and routes, as well as monitoring flight status. This project was developed as a part of my CS 4400 (Intr to Database Systems) course to demonstrate skills in database design, SQL programming, and database management.

<h2>Languages and Libraries Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>SQL</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Database Structure:</b> The SAMS is created with multiple entities including airlines, airports, airplanes, routes, and flights. The relationships between these entities are modeled using foreign keys to ensure data integrity.</li>
    <li><b>Stored Procedures:</b> A set of procedures are stored for common operations such as adding new airplanes, creating new flights, and updating flight statuses.</li>
    <li><b>Views:</b> Several SQL views are implemented to simplify data retrieval. These views provide insights into ongoing and grounded flights, as well as airports by location.</li>
    <li><b>Data Integrity and Consistency:</b> Foreign keys and constraints are used to maintain data integrity enforce logical rules such as that a flight cannot be assigned to planes already in use. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Required</h2>
To correctly run this code you must have a Database Management System and SQL Client. I would recommend MySQL and MySQL Workbench.
